Combining Data from Multiple Sources

Project Objective

The goal of this project is to develop the foundational skills necessary for data acquisition, cleaning, and merging. Finance research often requires assembling datasets from various sources, and in this project, you I have combined stock price data distributed across multiple files. The output will be a single JSON file containing the combined data.

This project will helpful to test the following skills:
	•	Handling different file formats and structures
	•	Writing general code that can adapt to different file formats and sources
	•	Importing, cleaning, and merging data
	•	Using Python functions to read and process large data files
	•	Storing the combined data in JSON format for further analysis

Files Included
	•	project_desc.pdf: Provides additional project details and instructions.
	•	README.txt: This file, which explains the project.
	•	TICKERS.txt: Contains a list of tickers and their corresponding exchanges.
	•	zid_project1.py: Contains all the functions that are required to complete this project. You will need to implement specific parts of this file.
	•	data/: Contains multiple .dat files with stock price data for various tickers. Each ticker from TICKERS.txt will have a corresponding .dat file.

Project Workflow

Step 1: Setting the location of files and folders

Set the correct paths for the project folder, data sub-folder, and TICKERS.txt file using the os module to ensure the code works on different systems.

Step 2: Defining Source Data Format

Define the column names and widths for the source data files based on the README.txt file. This will help in extracting the correct data fields from the .dat files.

Step 3: Implement the get_tics function

Writing a function that reads the TICKERS.txt file, formats the tickers, and returns a list of tickers.

Step 4: Implement the read_dat function

Writing a function that reads a stock price data file for a given ticker and returns its contents as a list of lines.

Step 5: Implement the line_to_dict function

Writing a function that converts a single line of data from the .dat file into a dictionary, mapping the column names to their values.

Step 6: Implement the verify_tickers function

Writing a function that verifies if the tickers provided are valid by checking them against the dictionary returned by get_tics.

Step 7: Implement the verify_cols function

Writing a function that verifies the column names against the predefined COLUMNS list and raises an exception if any of the columns are invalid.

Step 8: Implement the create_data_dict function

Writing a function that combines the data from multiple .dat files into a single dictionary, where each ticker has its own data.

Step 9: Implement the create_json function

Writing a function that saves the combined data dictionary into a JSON file.

Step 10: Evaluation and Analysis

Write an analysis explaining how stock returns can be influenced by journalists’ articles, and discuss the relationship between the short-run predictability of trading volume and stock returns.
